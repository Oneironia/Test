About
======
Project Löyly is a free and open-source database for any Finland lover. The initial idea is to store an online version of my materials. Also, I can keep record of my knowledge by writing blogs. <br />
Löyly is the working title of the project. It refers to the steam that rises from the sauna stove or the heat of the sauna, it also refers to the soul of the body. Hope everyone can enjoy this cyber sauna lodge and the spirit of Finland!
